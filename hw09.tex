Homework 9. Due by 5pm on Thursday 11/7.

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) from a PhD student perspective.

\end{center}

Since the publication of {\em On Being a Scientist}, DEI has arisen as a new component of RCRS. 
We are going to investigate what DEI means, where it came from, and our obligations to DEI in the context of responsible conduct in research and scholarship.
You are not expected to read thoroughly through all the links below.
You can browse enough to satisfy your curiosity and to be able to answer the questions in your own words.
Write brief answers to the following questions, by editing the tex file available at \url{https://github.com/ionides/810f19}, and submit the resulting pdf file via Canvas.

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is {\em implicit bias} (synonymous in our DEI context to {\em unconscious bias} or {\em implicit stereotype})? Do you think it exists and is large enough to have societal consequences? 
\url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype}

YOUR ANSWER HERE.

\item What is the {\em Me Too} movement? \url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement}

YOUR ANSWER HERE.

\item Browse the American Statistical Association summary report from the task force on sexual harassment and assault, at \url{magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/07/01/asataskforce/}.
Why do you think this report is coming out in 2019, rather than earlier, or not at all?

YOUR ANSWER HERE.

\item This report mentions {\em ally training} which is perhaps a synonym for {\em bystander intervention training}. Give an example of a hypothetical situation where you might make a bystander intervention to improve DEI climate within the statistics profession. \url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_intervention}

YOUR ANSWER HERE.

\item What is {\em stereotype threat}? Do you think it exists and is large enough to have societal consequences? \url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat}

YOUR ANSWER HERE.

\item What is {\em microaggression}? Do you think it exists and is large enough to have societal consequences? \url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression}

YOUR ANSWER HERE.

\item Many US companies and universities now have DEI initiatives. What might you say about your contributions to DEI in an interview? This may require imagining your future at UM.
